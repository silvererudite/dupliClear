Assume a directory of files that can be full or empty.
Files are chunks of text that can be full or empty. The files are stored with
file name in normal english string. 
Whenever a user creates a file, he/she saves it in the system.
We store the file name hashed in memory. 
If a name already exists we list it in another directory called duplicates.
